## 🚀 What You Need to Do Next

### 1. Update Expo Project ID (2 minutes)

**File**: `services/notificationService.js`, line ~50

**Change**:
```javascript
projectId: 'your-expo-project-id',
```

**To**:
```javascript
projectId: 'your-actual-expo-project-id',
```

Get ID from:
- Expo Dashboard → Settings
- Run: `npx expo config` (look for projectId)

---

### 2. Test on Physical Devices (15-30 minutes)

**What you need**:
- 2 physical devices (iOS or Android)
- Both running app via Expo Go
- Different user accounts

**Quick Test** (5 minutes):
1. Device A: Login as User A
2. Device B: Login as User B (stay on home screen)
3. Device A: Send message to User B
4. Device B: **Notification banner appears!** ✨
5. Device B: Tap banner → navigates to chat

**Full Test Suite**: See `md_files/PR11_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (12 scenarios)
