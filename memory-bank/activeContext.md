# Active Context

## Current Status
**Phase**: PR 3 Complete - Firestore & Network Detection Working  
**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Next Milestone**: MVP (Tuesday EOD)  
**Firebase Project**: MessageAI-dev

## What We Just Did
- ✅ **PR 1**: Project Setup & Firebase Configuration - COMPLETE
- ✅ **PR 2**: Firebase Authentication - COMPLETE
- ✅ **PR 3**: Firestore Schema & Network Detection - COMPLETE
  - Documented complete Firestore schema in services/firestore.js
  - Extended Firestore service with 8 new functions for chats/messages
  - Created Zustand chat store and message store (scaffolded)
  - Built network status utility with useNetworkStatus hook
  - Created OfflineBanner component with smooth animations
  - Integrated network detection into root layout
  - All code compiles without linter errors

## Current Work Focus

### Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ **PR 1**: Project Setup - DONE
2. ✅ **PR 2**: Firebase Authentication - DONE
3. ✅ **PR 3**: Firestore Schema & Network Detection - DONE
4. **PR 4**: SQLite Local Database & Sync Strategy (NEXT)
   - Create SQLite database schema
   - Implement message and chat database operations
   - Build sync manager utility
   - Initialize database on app startup
   - Set up sync strategy (Firestore → SQLite)

### Today's Goal
Complete **PR 4: SQLite Local Database & Sync Strategy** from task list.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Tech Stack Confirmed
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Routing**: Expo Router (file-based navigation)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Local Database**: Expo SQLite
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Cloud Functions, FCM)
- **Network Detection**: @react-native-community/netinfo
- **Authentication**: Email/Password (primary), Google OAuth (post-MVP)

### Recent Key Decisions

#### Authentication Strategy Change (PR 2)
**Decision**: Use Email/Password authentication for MVP; defer Google OAuth to post-MVP Phase 2

**Rationale**:
- Google OAuth consent screen setup proved time-consuming during MVP sprint
- Email/Password auth is simpler and unblocks development immediately
- Core messaging features are higher priority than OAuth polish
- Google OAuth can be added post-MVP without affecting existing users
- Both auth methods can coexist (users can link accounts later)

**Implementation**:
- Created complete Email/Password auth flow with sign-up/sign-in toggle
- Google OAuth code remains in codebase but unused
- Documentation preserved in `planning/md_files/` for future implementation

**Impact**:
- ✅ Unblocked PR 2 completion, can proceed to PR 3
- ✅ Users can create accounts and test immediately
- ⚠️ Will need to add Google OAuth back post-MVP (estimated 2-3 hours)
- ⚠️ Firestore security rules currently open (will secure in PR 16)

#### Firestore Security Rules (Temporary)
**Decision**: Open Firestore to all authenticated users for MVP development

**Current Rules**:
```javascript
match /{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Unblocks rapid development and testing
- Sufficient security for MVP testing phase (no production users yet)
- Will implement proper granular rules in PR 16

**Next Steps for Production**:
- PR 16 will add proper rules (users can only read/write their own data)
- Will implement chat participant validation
- Will add rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Architecture Approach
**Offline-First with Firestore as Source of Truth**:
- SQLite serves as read cache + write queue
- Firestore is authoritative source for all data
- On conflict, Firestore always wins
- Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback

### Key Design Decisions

#### Message Sync Strategy
```
Send Flow:
1. Write to SQLite immediately (syncStatus: 'pending')
2. Show in UI instantly (optimistic)
3. Async write to Firestore
4. On success: Update SQLite (syncStatus: 'synced')
5. Update UI with confirmation

Receive Flow:
1. Firestore listener fires
2. Write to SQLite
3. Update Zustand state
4. UI re-renders automatically
```

#### Network Handling
- Use NetInfo for connection detection
- Show persistent banner when offline
- Disable send button while offline
- Auto-process queue on reconnect
- Exponential backoff for retries (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, max 30s)
- Max 5 retry attempts, then mark as failed

#### Presence Tracking
- Update on app foreground/background
- Use Firestore onDisconnect() handlers
- Throttle updates (max 1 per 30 seconds)
- Track in /users/{userID} document

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
None yet - just starting!

### Potential Risks
1. **Time Constraint**: MVP deadline is aggressive (24 hours)
   - Mitigation: Follow task list strictly, no scope creep
   - Priority: Core messaging over polish

2. **Firebase Setup Complexity**: First-time setup can be tricky
   - Mitigation: Follow documentation carefully
   - Test connection early

3. **Offline Sync Complexity**: Most challenging technical aspect
   - Mitigation: Build incrementally, test after each PR
   - Start with simple cases, handle edge cases later

4. **Testing on Physical Devices**: Emulators don't represent real behavior
   - Mitigation: Test on physical device from day 1
   - Use Expo Go for quick iteration

## What's Working
Nothing yet - project hasn't started!

## What Needs Attention
1. **Firebase account setup** - Need valid credentials
2. **Development device** - Need physical iOS/Android device for testing
3. **Environment variables** - Need secure .env setup
4. **Git workflow** - Need clean commit strategy

## Questions to Resolve
1. **Persona Selection**: Which user persona will we target for Phase 2 AI features?
   - Can decide after MVP is complete
   - Options: Remote Team Professional, International Communicator, Busy Parent, Content Creator

2. **Testing Strategy**: How will we test with 2+ devices?
   - Expo Go on multiple devices
   - Create test user accounts
   - Test offline scenarios with airplane mode

3. **Demo Approach**: How to capture demo video?
   - Screen recording on devices
   - Show split-screen for real-time sync
   - Record offline scenarios clearly

## Next Session Planning

### PR 1 Checklist (Project Setup)
- [ ] Initialize Expo project
- [ ] Install all dependencies
- [ ] Create Firebase project
- [ ] Configure Firebase in app
- [ ] Set up directory structure
- [ ] Create .env file
- [ ] Initialize Git
- [ ] Test app launches on device
- [ ] Commit: "feat: initialize project with Firebase"

### Success Criteria for Today
- App launches on physical device without errors
- Firebase config loads successfully
- Can navigate between empty screens
- Git repository initialized with first commit
- Ready to start PR 2 (Authentication)

## Context for Next Session
When resuming:
1. Check if Firebase is configured correctly
2. Verify app runs on physical device
3. Review any console errors/warnings
4. Proceed to PR 2: Firebase Authentication
