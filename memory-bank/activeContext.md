# Active Context

## Current Status
**Phase**: Phase 2 AI Implementation - PIVOTING TO GLOBAL FEATURES 🔄  
**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Current PR**: PR20 COMPLETE ✅ (Global Summary Infrastructure)  
**Firebase Project**: MessageAI-dev  
**Major Change**: Moving from per-chat AI features to global, proactive intelligence

## ✅ Major Pivot: From Per-Chat to Global AI Features (October 23, 2025)

**Decision:** Moved from chat-specific AI features to global, proactive intelligence that works across all conversations.

**Rationale:**
- Better aligned with "busy working professional" persona
- Showcases system-level thinking and product maturity
- More impressive technically (cross-chat analysis, priority scoring, delta processing)
- Meets rubric requirements with integrated approach (e.g., decision tracking via Action Items filter)

**New Architecture:**
1. **Global Summary on App Open** - Auto-popup summarizing ALL unread messages
2. **AI Priority Chat Ordering** - Chat list sorted by importance, not recency
3. **Global Action Items Tab** - New bottom tab for all commitments across chats
4. **Global Smart Search Tab** - Two-stage semantic search across all messages
5. **Background Priority Detection** - Real-time urgency analysis as messages arrive

**Removed Features:**
- ❌ Per-chat AI Insights Panel (replaced with global approach)
- ❌ Separate Decision Tracking page (folded into Action Items filter)

**Key Technical Innovations:**
- **Delta processing** - Only analyze new messages since last watermark
- **Hybrid priority scoring** - Lightweight local score + selective AI analysis
- **Two-stage search** - Fast initial results, then refined accuracy
- **Progressive loading** - Show cached instantly, refresh in background
- **Cost optimization** - Aggressive caching (15min summary, 6hr priorities)

**Implementation Plan:**
- **PR20:** Global Summary Infrastructure (delta processing, watermarks, auto-popup)
- **PR21:** AI Priority Ordering (hybrid scoring, urgent indicators)
- **PR22:** Global Action Items + Smart Search Tabs
- **PR23:** Polish & Optimization (one-tap actions, tooltips, performance)

**New Documentation:**
- Created `planning/PRD_AI_extend.md` - Comprehensive PRD for global features
- Updated `planning/architecture.mermaid` - New global AI flows
- Created `planning/tasks_AI_extend.md` - Detailed task breakdown (4 PRs)

## Current Work Focus

### MVP Status - ALL COMPLETE ✅
1. ✅ **PR 1-12**: All MVP features implemented and tested
2. ✅ **MVP Testing**: All core features validated on physical devices

### Phase 2 Status - PLANNING COMPLETE ✅
**Planning Phase**: COMPLETE (October 22, 2025)
- ✅ Persona selected: Remote Team Professional
- ✅ All 5 features defined with specifications
- ✅ Technical architecture designed
- ✅ Implementation plan created (7 PRs)
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies identified

**Implementation Phase**: READY TO START
- **PR 16**: AI Infrastructure Setup (OpenAI, Langchain, caching)
- **PR 17**: Priority Detection Feature
- **PR 18**: Thread Summarization Feature (RAG showcase)
- **PR 19**: Action Item Extraction Feature
- **PR 20**: Smart Search Feature (semantic search)
- **PR 21**: Decision Tracking Feature (advanced)
- **PR 22**: Polish, Testing & Demo

### Post-Phase 2 (Future)
- Firestore security rules hardening
- Background push notifications
- Production deployment (EAS Build)
- Google OAuth re-implementation
- Performance optimization
- Additional persona features

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Tech Stack Confirmed
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Routing**: Expo Router (file-based navigation)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Local Database**: Expo SQLite
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Cloud Functions, FCM)
- **Network Detection**: @react-native-community/netinfo
- **Authentication**: Email/Password (primary), Google OAuth (post-MVP)

### Recent Key Decisions

#### Authentication Strategy Change (PR 2)
**Decision**: Use Email/Password authentication for MVP; defer Google OAuth to post-MVP Phase 2

**Rationale**:
- Google OAuth consent screen setup proved time-consuming during MVP sprint
- Email/Password auth is simpler and unblocks development immediately
- Core messaging features are higher priority than OAuth polish
- Google OAuth can be added post-MVP without affecting existing users
- Both auth methods can coexist (users can link accounts later)

**Implementation**:
- Created complete Email/Password auth flow with sign-up/sign-in toggle
- Google OAuth code remains in codebase but unused
- Documentation preserved in `planning/md_files/` for future implementation

**Impact**:
- ✅ Unblocked PR 2 completion, can proceed to PR 3
- ✅ Users can create accounts and test immediately
- ⚠️ Will need to add Google OAuth back post-MVP (estimated 2-3 hours)
- ⚠️ Firestore security rules currently open (will secure in PR 16)

#### Firestore Security Rules (Temporary)
**Decision**: Open Firestore to all authenticated users for MVP development

**Current Rules**:
```javascript
match /{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Unblocks rapid development and testing
- Sufficient security for MVP testing phase (no production users yet)
- Will implement proper granular rules in PR 16

**Next Steps for Production**:
- PR 16 will add proper rules (users can only read/write their own data)
- Will implement chat participant validation
- Will add rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Architecture Approach
**Offline-First with Firestore as Source of Truth**:
- SQLite serves as read cache + write queue
- Firestore is authoritative source for all data
- On conflict, Firestore always wins
- Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback

### Key Design Decisions

#### Message Sync Strategy
```
Send Flow:
1. Write to SQLite immediately (syncStatus: 'pending')
2. Show in UI instantly (optimistic)
3. Async write to Firestore
4. On success: Update SQLite (syncStatus: 'synced')
5. Update UI with confirmation

Receive Flow:
1. Firestore listener fires
2. Write to SQLite
3. Update Zustand state
4. UI re-renders automatically
```

#### Network Handling
- Use NetInfo for connection detection
- Show persistent banner when offline
- Disable send button while offline
- Auto-process queue on reconnect
- Exponential backoff for retries (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, max 30s)
- Max 5 retry attempts, then mark as failed

#### Presence Tracking
- Update on app foreground/background
- Use Firestore onDisconnect() handlers
- Throttle updates (max 1 per 30 seconds)
- Track in /users/{userID} document

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
None yet - just starting!

### Potential Risks
1. **Time Constraint**: Somewhat constrained for MVP
   - Mitigation: Follow task list strictly, no scope creep
   - Priority: Core messaging over polish

2. **Firebase Setup Complexity**: First-time setup can be tricky
   - Mitigation: Follow documentation carefully
   - Test connection early

3. **Offline Sync Complexity**: Most challenging technical aspect
   - Mitigation: Build incrementally, test after each PR
   - Start with simple cases, handle edge cases later

4. **Testing on Physical Devices**: Emulators don't represent real behavior
   - Mitigation: Test on physical device from day 1
   - Use Expo Go for quick iteration

## What's Working
- ✅ Project setup complete with all dependencies installed
- ✅ Firebase configured and connected
- ✅ Email/Password authentication working
- ✅ Firestore schema and service layer complete
- ✅ Network detection with offline banner
- ✅ SQLite database with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Sync manager for offline-first architecture
- ✅ Automatic data persistence and recovery
- ✅ App lifecycle handling (startup, background, reconnect)
- ✅ Home screen with real-time chat list (tested on physical device)
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh functionality
- ✅ Navigation to chat detail and new chat screens
- ✅ Contact picker with search functionality
- ✅ 1:1 chat creation with duplicate prevention
- ✅ Group chat creation with name validation
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates when creating chats

## What Needs Attention
1. **Group Chat Polish**: Improve group chat UX (PR 12 - NEXT)
2. **App Lifecycle**: Handle crash recovery (PR 13)
