# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The WhatsApp Precedent
WhatsApp transformed how billions communicate by making messaging fast, reliable, and secure. Originally built by just two developers (Brian Acton and Jan Koum) in months, it now serves 2+ billion users worldwide. With modern AI coding tools, we can build comparable infrastructure in one week and push it further with intelligent features that didn't exist back then.

### The AI Opportunity
The future of messaging isn't just about sending texts—it's about intelligent communication. This project challenges us to build both:
1. **Production-quality messaging infrastructure** - Like WhatsApp
2. **AI features that enhance messaging** - Using LLMs, agents, and RAG pipelines

## Problems We're Solving

### Core Messaging Problems
1. **Message Reliability** - Messages must never get lost, even with poor connectivity
2. **Real-Time Delivery** - Instant message appearance across devices
3. **Offline Resilience** - Queue messages offline, sync when connection returns
4. **Data Persistence** - Survive crashes, force-quits, and app restarts
5. **Network Transitions** - Handle switching between WiFi/cellular gracefully

### User Pain Points (Persona-Specific)
Depending on chosen persona, we're solving different problems:

**Remote Team Professional**:
- Drowning in message threads
- Missing important messages
- Context switching between conversations
- Time zone coordination challenges

**International Communicator**:
- Language barriers in conversations
- Translation copy-paste overhead
- Cultural context misunderstandings
- Learning language from conversations

**Busy Parent/Caregiver**:
- Schedule juggling across multiple groups
- Missing important dates/appointments
- Decision fatigue from group chats
- Information overload

**Content Creator/Influencer**:
- Hundreds of DMs daily
- Repetitive questions from fans
- Spam vs. genuine opportunities
- Maintaining authentic voice at scale

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

#### Instant Feedback
- Messages appear immediately when sent (optimistic UI)
- Clear visual progression: sending → sent → delivered → read
- No waiting, no uncertainty

#### Graceful Degradation
- App works offline (view history, compose messages)
- Clear offline indicator (persistent banner)
- Messages queue automatically, send when online
- No user intervention required

#### Reliable Delivery
- Messages never lost, even on crash
- Consistent message ordering across devices
- Accurate read receipts
- Real-time presence indicators

#### Simple, Clean Interface
- Initial-based avatars (colorful, consistent)
- Clear message attribution in groups
- Unread badges and message previews
- Pull-to-refresh for manual sync

### Core User Flows

#### Flow 1: First Message
```
New User → Sign up → Empty chat list → Tap "New Chat" 
→ Select contact → Type message → Tap send 
→ Message appears instantly → Recipient receives within 2s 
→ Read receipt updates
```

#### Flow 2: Offline Recovery
```
User goes offline → Offline banner appears → Type message 
→ Tap send → Message shows "pending" 
→ Network returns → Banner disappears 
→ Message sends automatically → Normal flow resumes
```

#### Flow 3: Group Coordination
```
User creates group → Names it → Selects members → Sends message 
→ All members receive simultaneously → Each replies 
→ Clear sender attribution → Read receipts per member
```

#### Flow 4: Crash Recovery
```
User sends message → App crashes before confirmation 
→ User reopens app → App checks pending queue 
→ Message sends automatically → Recipient receives 
→ Chat history intact
```

### AI Experience Goals (Phase 2)

#### Contextual Intelligence
- AI understands conversation history (RAG pipeline)
- Suggestions are relevant to current context
- Actions performed with minimal user input

#### Proactive Assistance
- Detects needs before user asks
- Suggests actions at the right moment
- Never intrusive or annoying

#### Persona-Specific Value
- Each AI feature solves a real pain point
- Features work together cohesively
- Feels like a personal assistant
