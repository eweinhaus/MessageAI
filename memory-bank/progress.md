## Decisions Made
1. **Tech Stack Confirmed**: React Native + Expo, Firebase backend
2. **Offline-First Architecture**: SQLite cache + Firestore source of truth
3. **MVP Scope Locked**: Text-only, no media, foreground notifications only
4. **Persona Selection Deferred**: Will choose after MVP complete

## Open Questions
1. **Which persona for Phase 2?** (Can decide after MVP)
2. **Testing devices?** (Need 2+ physical devices for real-time sync testing)
3. **Demo recording approach?** (Split-screen or sequential?)

## Notes for Next Session
- Start with PR 6: Contact Picker & New Chat Creation
- Home screen is fully functional with real-time updates
- Need to implement user fetching and contact selection
- Implement chat creation logic (1:1 and group)
- Add duplicate chat prevention for 1:1 chats
- Create group name modal for group chats
- Test on physical device to verify end-to-end flow
- Follow task list strictly to stay on schedule
- No scope creep
