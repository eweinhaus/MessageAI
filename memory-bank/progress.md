## Decisions Made
1. **Tech Stack Confirmed**: React Native + Expo, Firebase backend

3. **MVP Scope Locked**: Text-only, no media, foreground notifications only
4. **Persona Selection Deferred**: Will choose after MVP complete

## Open Questions
1. **Which persona for Phase 2?** (Can decide after MVP)
2. **Testing devices?** (Need 2+ physical devices for real-time sync testing)
3. **Demo recording approach?** (Split-screen or sequential?)
